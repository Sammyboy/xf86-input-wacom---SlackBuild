The xf86-input-wacom driver provides desktop support for Wacom tablets, touchscreens, and similar hardware. It is responsible for relaying events from the kernel to the X server where applications like GIMP, Krita, and Xournal can make use of them. Additionally, it provides services like palm rejection that improve the experience of using a tablet.
